The protagonist stumbles upon a way to go back to medieval europe.
They decide to go on an adventure through medieval Europe, but they bring some supplies, just in case.
Once they arrive, they start to interact with the townspeople and soon start uncovering evidence of other people
from the future being there. 

Some possible evidence:
\The villagers talk of some hapless dictator who has the ability to cast death from an object the size of one's hand.
\You find evidence of machinery (nuts/screws) around the town
\The villagers joke of a group who ran through here earlier, looking much like you do, rich and eccentric with extraordinary dyed clothing.
\You note a massive cleared field of trees
\You find a pair of discarded sneakers hidden in the mud on the way into town.


Regardless,
An agency has set up shop here in the past, and exploiting the unexploited natural landscape of the past.
They are tearing up hills and mountains for (insert local natural resources here), causing
health problems for the people in the nearby village. Anyone that tries to confront them is promptly killed.
(the agency views these people as not human and thus does not care for their opinion on the matter)

You try to get back to the present, but find that you can't (maybe the way required modern resources or something like that).
Since you can't go back to find help, you are stranded in the past.
You decide to fight against the agency in order to protect the townspeople and the people of the future that you hold dear.
 / search for their way of transportation through time in order to escape yourself


After you return from the past, you find the world irrevocably changed by the agencies' actions.
